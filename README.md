Android
=======
This repo contains sample Android sample applications from 
the Android tutorial book found here: 
http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/android-programming.html.
I highly recommend the book to anyone who knows java
and is interested in learning Android.  The authors provide 
a step by step guide for writing all of these sample apps,
and they thoroughly explain each step in
a way that is accessible to programmers with no Android 
experience.  The apps are pretty basic, but they certainly
helped me develop familiarity key concepts of Android 
programming.  

## Geo Quiz
The code for this app is pretty simple.  It introduces the
reader to application life-cycles, Android's 
Model-View-Controller architecture, and methods for passing
data between activities and persisting data across screen
rotations.
